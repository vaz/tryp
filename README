Tryp is for making noise.

It is written for Ruby 1.9, has FFI wrappers for CoreMIDI, alsa and winmm.

Right now it can play MIDI with some half-decent timing, and smart notes
(you can use symbols like :C, :Db, or strings like 'C#', etc).

You can do a metronome yay.

Also now you can make it make polyrhythms and print out the tabs and
play them via MIDI (and control the bpm and stuff).

TODO:

I wanted to use MIDIator, but it currently breaks with Snow Leopard and
is using Ruby DL, which breaks on 1.9 because the API's changed.

aberant has a MIDIator fork that is active and seems to be going in the
right direction.

More TODO:

make this do something cool.
