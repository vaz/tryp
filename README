Tryp is for making noise.

It doesn't do anything interesting yet.

But it is written for Ruby 1.9, has FFI wrappers for CoreMIDI, alsa and winmm.


TODO:

I want to use MIDIator, but it currently breaks with Snow Leopard and
is using Ruby DL, which breaks on 1.9 because the API's changed.

aberant has a MIDIator fork that is active and seems to be going in the
right direction.

More TODO:

make this do something cool.
